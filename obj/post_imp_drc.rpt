2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP ccl_moore_addr_00 input ccl_moore_addr_00/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP ccl_moore_addr_00 input ccl_moore_addr_00/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mnt_ccl_0/addra_1_reg[15]_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mnt_ccl_0/addra_1_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell mnt_ccl_0/addra_1_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mnt_ccl_0/frame_buff_pixel__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mnt_ccl_0/frame_buff_pixel_reg_i_1/O, cell mnt_ccl_0/frame_buff_pixel_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mnt_ccl_0/scan_x_out_reg[10]_i_1_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mnt_ccl_0/scan_x_out_reg[10]_i_1/O, cell mnt_ccl_0/scan_x_out_reg[10]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
